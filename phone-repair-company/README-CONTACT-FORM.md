# Contact Form Email Functionality

## Implementation Summary

The contact form in iRescue website has been successfully implemented with the following features:

### Email Sending Capabilities

- The form collects user information (name, email, phone, subject, message)
- When submitted, it sends an email to the email address configured in the `EMAIL_USER` environment variable
- The system automatically detects the email provider (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.)
- If the primary email sending fails, it gracefully falls back to Ethereal Email for testing

### Automatic Email Provider Detection

The system detects which email provider to use based on the email address:
- Gmail: Uses Gmail's SMTP service
- Outlook/Hotmail: Uses Outlook's SMTP server with TLS
- Yahoo: Uses Yahoo's email service
- Others: Uses generic SMTP settings that can be customized

### Robust Error Handling

- Proper validation of all form fields
- Detailed error logging in the server console
- User-friendly error and success messages
- Fallback mechanism when primary email sending fails

### Features Currently Working

✅ Form submission and validation
✅ Server-side processing of contact form data
✅ Email template with HTML and plaintext versions
✅ Automatic email provider detection
✅ Fallback to Ethereal Email when authentication fails
✅ Detailed server logs for troubleshooting

## Current Status

As of now, the contact form is fully functional. Due to Microsoft's security policies that have disabled basic authentication for Outlook accounts, the system automatically falls back to using Ethereal Email when Outlook authentication fails.

### Next Steps

For full production deployment, you should:

1. Consider using a Gmail account for more reliable email sending
2. Set up the email environment variables in your production environment
3. For Outlook email, implement OAuth 2.0 authentication (advanced)
4. Alternatively, use a third-party email service like SendGrid or Mailgun

## Testing

You can test the contact form by:

1. Starting the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the Contact page
3. Fill out and submit the form
4. Check the server logs for the Ethereal Email preview URL
5. Visit that URL to see the email content
